This Unity3D project generates Perlin noise and Worley noise and applies them to textures. The noise textures can be used for terrain generation, procedural patterns, or other creative effects in game development.

## Features

- **Perlin Noise**: Smooth, natural-looking gradients ideal for terrain and organic textures.  
- **Worley Noise**: Cell-based patterns useful for generating stone, water, or organic textures.  
- **Texture Output**: Renders noise directly onto textures for easy use in Unity.  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust frequency, scale, and other settings to fine-tune the noise.
